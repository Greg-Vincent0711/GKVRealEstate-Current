          Real Estate Investing can serve as a way to secure yourself and family
          financially. However, it is not solely about collecting passive income. 
          At the end of the day, people's livelihoods are tied to your decisions, which is why it is
          more important to form honest and amicable relationships with tenants,
          so that both parties are satisfied.
